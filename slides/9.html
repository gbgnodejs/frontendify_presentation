    If I want require in the browser....Browserify it is!
  </p>
  <p>
    Wait what about es6 import....maybe but not yet
  </p>
  <p>
    Require is synchronous, and what about page load?
  </p>

    Cache all the things? code is read many more times than loaded, it cached that is :)
  </p>
  <p>
    Service worker, appcached, modularity is the key
  </p>
  <p>
    How we do modularity in js, yeah no-one agrees!!!!!!
